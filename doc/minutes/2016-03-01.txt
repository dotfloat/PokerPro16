IDE:
Because of the use of ANT we won't decide on an IDE.

Slack:
We have decided to use slack for easy communication.

Trello:
We have decided to use Trello for managing to-dos. Trello also has an application for Slack.

Diagrams:
We will use draw.io for creating diagrams. Draw.io saves as .html and makes it easy to track changes.

GUI:
Swing. Simple java based GUIs.
